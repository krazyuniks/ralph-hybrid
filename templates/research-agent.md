## Summary

A 2-3 sentence overview of the most important findings about {{TOPIC}}.

## Key Findings

List your findings as bullet points. Each finding should include:
- A clear, actionable statement
- Supporting evidence or reasoning
- Relevance to software development

### Finding 1
**[Title of finding]**
- Description: [What you discovered]
- Evidence: [Source or reasoning]
- Impact: [How this affects development decisions]

### Finding 2
**[Title of finding]**
- Description: [What you discovered]
- Evidence: [Source or reasoning]
- Impact: [How this affects development decisions]

### Finding 3
**[Title of finding]**
- Description: [What you discovered]
- Evidence: [Source or reasoning]
- Impact: [How this affects development decisions]

(Add more findings as needed using the same structure)

## Confidence Level

Rate your overall confidence in these findings:

**Confidence: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]**

### Confidence Criteria

- **HIGH**: Based on official documentation, widely-accepted best practices, or verified authoritative sources. Multiple consistent sources confirm the findings.
- **MEDIUM**: Based on community consensus, multiple blog posts or tutorials, or consistent patterns across several projects. Some variation in approaches exists.
- **LOW**: Based on single sources, limited evidence, emerging/unstable practices, or conflicting information. Findings may change as more information becomes available.

### Confidence Reasoning
[Explain why you assigned this confidence level. What sources did you rely on? What uncertainties remain?]

## Sources

List all sources consulted during research:

1. [Source title](URL) - [Brief description of what was found]
2. [Source title](URL) - [Brief description of what was found]
3. [Source title](URL) - [Brief description of what was found]

If no URLs are available (e.g., knowledge-based reasoning), describe the source:
- Official documentation for [technology]
- Common industry practice
- Direct experience/testing

## Recommendations

Based on this research, provide:

1. **Recommended approach**: [What should the development team do?]
2. **Alternatives considered**: [Other valid approaches and why they were not recommended]
3. **Open questions**: [What needs further investigation or clarification?]
