# post-iteration-tracking-commit.sh
# Automatically commits ralph tracking files after each iteration.
#
# This hook eliminates the need for Claude to run:
#   git add .ralph-hybrid/ && git commit -m "chore: Update ralph tracking files"
#
# INSTALLATION:
# 1. Copy to your project's .ralph-hybrid/{feature}/hooks/ directory
# 2. Make executable: chmod +x post-iteration-tracking-commit.sh
# 3. The hook runs automatically after each iteration
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (set by Ralph):
# - RALPH_HYBRID_FEATURE_DIR: Path to feature directory
# - RALPH_HYBRID_FEATURE_NAME: Feature name
# - RALPH_HYBRID_ITERATION: Current iteration number
#
# NOTE: This hook runs AFTER Claude finishes but BEFORE the next iteration.
# If Claude already committed the tracking files, this hook will do nothing.
