Story: STORY-001 - Hook Execution Infrastructure
Status: complete

Changes made:
- Added run_hook() function to lib/hooks.sh for backpressure verification
- Added RALPH_HYBRID_EXIT_VERIFICATION_FAILED=75 constant to constants.sh
- Hook receives JSON context file as argument with story_id, iteration, feature_dir, output_file, timestamp
- Hook lookup: feature-specific hooks first (.ralph-hybrid/{branch}/hooks/), then project-wide (.ralph-hybrid/hooks/)
- Configurable timeout via RALPH_HYBRID_HOOK_TIMEOUT (default: 300s)
- Added _find_hook_script() helper function for hook discovery
- Added hook_exists() utility function

Verification:
- Created tests/unit/test_hooks.sh with 12 unit tests covering all acceptance criteria
- All 12 unit tests pass
- e2e tests pass (7 tests, no regressions)

- Template demonstrates test command execution via configurable TEST_COMMAND
- Supports npm test, pytest, just test, go test, cargo test, make test patterns
- Returns exit code 0 on pass, 75 (VERIFICATION_FAILED) on test failure
- Added _setup_copy_hook_templates() function to ralph-hybrid for setup command
- Converted unit tests from custom bash scripts to BATS format for CI compatibility

Story: STORY-009 - Plan Checker Agent
Status: complete

Changes made:
- Created templates/plan-checker.md with six-dimension verification

  2. Completeness - verifies each story is fully specified and implementable
  3. Dependencies - verifies story ordering and dependencies are correct
  4. Links - verifies references and connections are valid
  5. Scope - verifies plan is appropriately scoped for iterative implementation
  6. Verification - verifies adequate verification approach is defined
- Issue classification with clear criteria:
  - BLOCKER: Must be fixed before implementation can succeed
  - WARNING: Should be addressed but won't prevent basic implementation
  - INFO: Observations and suggestions for improvement
- PLAN-REVIEW.md output format with:
  - Summary and Verdict (READY/NEEDS_REVISION/BLOCKED)
  - Issue Summary table with counts per severity
  - Individual issue sections with Location, Description, Impact, Recommendation
  - Dimension Summary table showing PASS/WARN/FAIL per dimension
  - Recommendations section (Before/During/After implementation)
- Verdict criteria:
  - READY: Zero BLOCKERs
  - NEEDS_REVISION: Fixable BLOCKERs
  - BLOCKED: Significant issues requiring major changes
