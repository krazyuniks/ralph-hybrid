- Hook lookup: feature-specific hooks first (.ralph-hybrid/{branch}/hooks/), then project-wide (.ralph-hybrid/hooks/)
- Configurable timeout via RALPH_HYBRID_HOOK_TIMEOUT (default: 300s)
- Added _find_hook_script() helper function for hook discovery
- Added hook_exists() utility function

Story: STORY-002 - Backpressure Hook Template
Status: complete

Changes made:
- Created templates/hooks/post_iteration.sh backpressure verification hook template

- Template demonstrates test command execution via configurable TEST_COMMAND
- Supports npm test, pytest, just test, go test, cargo test, make test patterns
- Returns exit code 0 on pass, 75 (VERIFICATION_FAILED) on test failure
- Added _setup_copy_hook_templates() function to ralph-hybrid for setup command
- Converted unit tests from custom bash scripts to BATS format for CI compatibility
- Created tests/integration/ directory for CI

Verification:
- 27 BATS unit tests pass (12 for hooks.sh, 15 for hook template)
- e2e tests pass (7 tests, no regressions)
- Tested ralph-hybrid setup copies hooks to project directory
- Bash syntax checks pass for all scripts
