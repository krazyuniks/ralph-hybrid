Iteration: 1
Started: 2026-01-23T01:58:26Z
Story: STORY-001 - Hook Execution Infrastructure
Status: complete

Changes made:
- Added run_hook() function to lib/hooks.sh for backpressure verification
- Added RALPH_HYBRID_EXIT_VERIFICATION_FAILED=75 constant to constants.sh
- Hook receives JSON context file as argument with story_id, iteration, feature_dir, output_file, timestamp
- Hook lookup: feature-specific hooks first (.ralph-hybrid/{branch}/hooks/), then project-wide (.ralph-hybrid/hooks/)
- Configurable timeout via RALPH_HYBRID_HOOK_TIMEOUT (default: 300s)
- Added _find_hook_script() helper function for hook discovery
- Added hook_exists() utility function

Verification:
- Created tests/unit/test_hooks.sh with 12 unit tests covering all acceptance criteria
- All 12 unit tests pass
- e2e tests pass (7 tests, no regressions)

Story: STORY-002 - Backpressure Hook Template
Status: complete

Changes made:
- Created templates/hooks/post_iteration.sh backpressure verification hook template
- Template parses JSON context with jq (with grep/sed fallback for systems without jq)
- Template demonstrates test command execution via configurable TEST_COMMAND
- Supports npm test, pytest, just test, go test, cargo test, make test patterns
- Returns exit code 0 on pass, 75 (VERIFICATION_FAILED) on test failure
- Added _setup_copy_hook_templates() function to ralph-hybrid for setup command
- Converted unit tests from custom bash scripts to BATS format for CI compatibility
- Created tests/integration/ directory for CI

Verification:
- 27 BATS unit tests pass (12 for hooks.sh, 15 for hook template)
- e2e tests pass (7 tests, no regressions)
- Tested ralph-hybrid setup copies hooks to project directory
- Bash syntax checks pass for all scripts

Story: STORY-003 - Integrate Backpressure into Iteration Loop
Status: complete

Changes made:
- Added _run_backpressure_gate() function to ralph-hybrid script
- Integrated backpressure verification into _run_handle_completion() for both story_complete and complete signals
- Extended lib/config.sh YAML parser to support 3-level nesting (hooks.post_iteration.enabled)
- Config schema supports hooks.post_iteration.enabled (default: true if hook exists)
- Config supports hooks.timeout for hook execution timeout (default: 300s)
- Backpressure gate checks hook_exists() before running (backward compatible)
- VERIFICATION_FAILED (exit 75) triggers story rollback and circuit breaker increment
- Updated templates/config.yaml.example with hooks section documentation
- Created tests/integration/test_backpressure_integration.bats with 10 integration tests

Verification:
- 37 BATS tests pass (12 hooks.sh + 15 hook template + 10 integration)
- e2e tests pass (7 tests, no regressions)
- Bash syntax checks pass for ralph-hybrid, lib/config.sh, lib/hooks.sh
